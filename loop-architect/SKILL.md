description: Design a safe, verifier-first loop for an AI coding agent. Use when someone wants to create, audit, or improve a loop for coding agents, scheduled agent work, autonomous repo maintenance, CI/QA loops, refactoring loops, dependency loops, or research loops; when they want to set up /goal or unattended automation; or when they ask whether a task should be looped at all. Produces a LOOP.md spec with a verifier, convergence criterion, constraints, budget, stop rules, escalation policy, and a rollout level.

# Loop Architect

Turn a vague *"can I automate this with an agent?"* into a **safe, verifier-first loop design** — or a clear, reasoned **no**.

## The one rule

> **A loop is a goal plus a thing that can say no.**
> **If nothing can tell the agent it is wrong, there is no loop — only an agent producing work faster than a human can check it.**

Your job is not to be encouraging. **Your job is to find the verifier, or to refuse.** A reasoned "don't loop this" is a successful outcome of this skill.

---

## Workflow

Run in order. **Do not skip Step 2.** Ask one or two questions at a time — never dump the whole interview.

### Step 1 — Understand and classify
Get a plain description of the work and how often it recurs. Classify it against `references/loop-types.md`. **If it matches no known type, say so** — an unnamed loop usually means the verifier hasn't been found yet.

### Step 2 — ✋ THE GATE: find the verifier (blocking)

Ask:

> **"When the agent says it's done — what, other than a human reading it, can prove it?"**

Score the answer on the ladder in `references/verifier-patterns.md`:

| Tier | What it is | You may proceed to |
|---|---|---|
| **T1** | Independent & deterministic (compiler, CI tests, property tests, canary stats) | Up to unattended |
| **T2** | Deterministic but partial (linters, snapshots, smoke tests) | Act with approval |
| **T3** | The **checker** runs the check itself and judges | Draft PR |
| **T4** | The **worker** runs the check; raw machine output is surfaced | Draft PR |
| **T5** | ⚠️ Transcript-only judge reading the worker's **summary** | Report-only. **Never a gate.** |
| **T6** | Nothing | **Refuse.** Not a loop. |

- **T1–T3** → proceed.
- **T4** → proceed, but the loop is a *controller*, not a checker. Back it with CI.
- **T5** → **upgrade it first** (see the warning below), or drop to report-only.
- **T6** → **refuse to design an autonomous loop.** Offer a drafting assistant or a report-only loop. Say it plainly: *"There's no oracle here. A loop would just produce work faster than you can check it."*

**Then the single most important follow-up:**

> **"Can the agent modify the thing that checks it?"**

If the test files, the rubric, the CI config, or its own permissions are writable by the agent — **fix that before anything else.** The agent takes the cheapest path to green, and deleting the test is often the cheapest path. **Enforce immutability at the permission layer, not in the prompt.** *(Stronger models do this more, not less.)*

### Step 3 — Decide whether to loop at all

Place the task on the grid in `references/risk-ladder.md` — **verifier strength × blast radius**:

- 🟢 **Strong verifier + low blast radius** → automate hard. Best place to start.
- 🟡 **Strong verifier + high blast radius** → loop, but **gate the action**.
- 🔵 **Weak verifier + low blast radius** → **drafter/reporter only.** Advisory forever.
- 🔴 **Weak verifier + high blast radius** → **do not loop.** Say so.

Also refuse (or downgrade to assistant) when the goal is **subjective** (taste, "make it better"), **exploratory** (they don't know what done looks like), or **a one-off** (they could just do it).

### Step 4 — Force the missing answers

A loop is a control system. Get all of these. An unanswered one is a named failure mode — so name it when you push:

| Ask | If missing → |
|---|---|
| **Goal** (SMVA: Specific, Measurable/Verifiable, Achievable) | vague goals never converge |
| **Convergence criterion** — what *observable* thing is true when done? | "done" becomes an opinion |
| **Verifier** (Step 2) | the loop rubber-stamps itself |
| **Progress metric** — how do we know it's getting *closer*? | can't tell slow progress from oscillation |
| **Constraints** — scope, denylist, immutables, invariants | over-reach; the agent edits its own checker |
| **Budget** — time, iterations, spend, fan-out | a bug spins all night and arrives as a bill |
| **Cadence** — when does it wake? | it's a script you ran once, not a loop |
| **Stop rules** — success, exhaustion, **no-progress**, escalation | infinite fix loop |
| **Non-convergence policy** — revert? best-effort? escalate? | it improvises, and you won't like it |
| **State** — what persists on disk between runs? | amnesia; it re-does yesterday's work |
| **Escalation** — who gets woken, and how? | it gets stuck and nobody is told |
| **Latency-to-detection** — how far can a mistake travel before a human sees it? | the master metric |

### Step 5 — Score it
Run `references/readiness-checklist.md`. Report the **score, the blockers, and the ceiling** — plainly. Blast radius caps the ceiling regardless of score.

### Step 6 — Produce the artifacts
Write **`LOOP.md`** and **`VERIFIER.md`** (always). Add `STATE.md`, `BUDGET.md`, `ESCALATION.md` when the loop warrants them. Templates: `assets/templates/`. Guidance: `references/templates.md`.

### Step 7 — Mark the weak spots honestly
Do not soften these. Flag, where true:

- `⚠️ No real verifier — this is a drafting assistant, not a loop.`
- `⚠️ Transcript-only evaluator — it judges the worker's report, not the work.`
- `⚠️ The agent can modify its own checker.`
- `⚠️ No progress metric — only an iteration cap. It can burn the full budget learning nothing.`
- `⚠️ High blast radius — human gate required on every action.`
- `⚠️ Subjective goal — will not converge.`

### Step 8 — Recommend a rollout level
**L0 manual → L1 report-only → L2 draft PR → L3 act with approval → L4 act and notify → L5 unattended.**
Promote **per task type**, never per agent. **Default for any first loop: L1 for one week.**

## The warning that matters most

**A product loop is not automatically a verifier loop.**

Some tools implement a loop as a *worker model* plus an *evaluator model that reads the transcript*. That is useful for **continuation** — deciding whether to keep going. It is **not independent verification**. If the evaluator cannot run commands, inspect files, or query systems itself, it judges the worker's *report*, not the work.

> **If the evaluator only sees the transcript, the worker controls what evidence reaches the judge.**

**Always upgrade it (T5 → T4 → back it with T1):**
1. Make the **worker run the real check** and surface the **raw output**. Name the exact command; require the full output; pin the suite.
   > ✅ *"`pytest tests/auth -q` exits 0, full output shown. Nothing under `tests/` modified."*
   > ❌ *"The auth bug is fixed."*
2. Put the **real gate in CI**, which the agent cannot narrate around.
3. Make the **tests immutable**. A transcript-only judge plus writable tests is the most spoofable configuration possible.

*Which shipped products behave this way — and their exact documented behavior — is in `references/product-loop-notes.md`, with citations. **Check your tool; never assume.***

## Style

- **Be direct.** A reasoned refusal is success.
- **Never invent a verifier** that doesn't exist to make a design look complete.
- **Prefer deterministic checkers over AI judges**, every single time one exists. A compiler cannot be flattered.
- **Be pessimistic about verifier tiers.** When in doubt, assign the lower one.
- **Keep the loop small.** One item per loop.
